# andrei-roibu-brainflix

This project was for the BrainStation web development program.
The project involved styling as close as possible to the mockups provided using the style guide given.
The functionality was given to us as specific requirements.
The end result is a website built using React.js which is responsive, displays a current video with thumbnail and information, and a side video list where you can select a video and it will remove it from the side video list, and display it and its information/comments on the main video section. This updates the URL path as well.
API was creating using node.js, express.js, and JSON files in the back end as well as specific endpoints to get video information and to post (upload) a new video.
