The purpose of this project was to practice React.js, SASS, Node.js, and Express.js.
The end result is a website built using React.js which is responsive, displays a current video thumbnail and information, and a side video list where you can select a video and it will remove it from the side video list, and display it and its information/comments on the main video section. This updates the URL path as well.
API was creating using node.js, express.js, and JSON files in the back end as well as specific endpoints to get video information and to post (upload) a new video.
